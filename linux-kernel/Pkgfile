# Developers Note
#
# This package does not build anything. It
# just makes the download of the latest Linux Kernel
# much easier. If you install this package on multiple
# servers you don't have to manually download and
# extract the entire kernel.
#
# This package also exports the current kernel config
# into the kernel directory. This is the reason you
# should NOT use a binary version of this package.
#
# After installing the package you have to update
# your kernel config and then compile it
# the way you want.

build ()
{
	# create a folder structure
	mkdir -p $PKG/usr/src/

	# copy all files into the package
	cp -r $SRC/linux-$version $PKG/usr/src/

	# get the current kernel config
	zcat /proc/config.gz > $PKG/usr/src/linux-$version/.config
}
